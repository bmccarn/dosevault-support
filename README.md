  ### General                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                          
  **Is my data private?**                                                                                                 
  Yes. All data is stored locally on your device using Apple's SwiftData framework. Nothing is transmitted to external    
  servers. We have no access to your medication data.                                                                     
                                                                                                                          
  **Can I sync data between devices?**                                                                                    
  Not currently. All data stays on the device where it was entered. We recommend using the Export feature to back up your 
  data.                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                          
  **How do I export my data?**                                                                                            
  Go to Settings → Export Data. You can export as CSV (for spreadsheets) or JSON (for backups).                           
                                                                                                                          
  ### Medications & Scheduling                                                                                            
                                                                                                                          
  **How do I add a new medication?**                                                                                      
  Tap the Medications tab → tap the + button → fill in the details.                                                       
                                                                                                                          
  **What does "E3.5D" mean?**                                                                                             
  Every 3.5 days, which equals twice per week. This is a common TRT schedule.                                             
                                                                                                                          
  **Can I track as-needed medications?**                                                                                  
  Yes. When adding a medication, select "As Needed" for the schedule type.                                                
                                                                                                                          
  ### Vials & Supply                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                          
  **How do I add a vial to track supply?**                                                                                
  Use the Reconstitution calculator to calculate your concentration, then tap "Save as Vial" and link it to a medication. 
  For non-reconstituted vials (like testosterone cypionate), you can add supply info when editing a medication.           
                                                                                                                          
  **Why isn't my vial volume decreasing?**                                                                                
  Make sure the vial is linked to the medication you're logging. Check the medication detail view to verify a vial is     
  attached.                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                          
  **How do I replace an empty vial?**                                                                                     
  Go to the medication detail view → tap "Replace Vial". This creates a new vial with the same concentration and resets   
  the volume.                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                          
  ### Calculators                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                          
  **What's the difference between the calculators?**                                                                      
  - **Dosage**: Calculates how much to draw (mL) based on concentration and desired dose                                  
  - **Reconstitution**: Calculates concentration after mixing powder with BAC water                                       
  - **Split Dose**: Divides a weekly dose by number of injections                                                         
  - **Unit Converter**: Converts between mcg, mg, g, and IU                                                               
                                                                                                                          
  **Can I save calculator results?**                                                                                      
  Yes. The Reconstitution calculator lets you save the result as a tracked vial linked to a medication.                   
                                                                                                                          
  ### Troubleshooting                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                          
  **The app crashed. What should I do?**                                                                                  
  Try force-quitting and reopening the app. If the issue persists, please open an issue with details about what you were  
  doing when it crashed.                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                          
  **I accidentally deleted something. Can I recover it?**                                                                 
  Unfortunately, deletions are permanent. We recommend regularly exporting your data as a backup.

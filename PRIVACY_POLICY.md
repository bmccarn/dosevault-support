# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: January 14, 2026**

## Overview

DoseVault ("the App") is developed by Blake McCarn ("we", "us", or "our"). This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our iOS application.

**The short version: We don't collect any of your data. Everything stays on your device.**

## Information Collection

### Data We Do NOT Collect

DoseVault does not collect, store, transmit, or have access to any of your personal information. Specifically, we do not collect:

- Personal identifiers (name, email, phone number)
- Health or medical information
- Medication data you enter in the app
- Injection logs or history
- Usage analytics or statistics
- Device identifiers
- Location data
- Any other personal data

### Data Storage

All data you enter into DoseVault—including medications, injection logs, vial information, and settings—is stored **locally on your device only** using Apple's SwiftData framework. This data:

- Never leaves your device
- Is not transmitted to any servers
- Is not accessible to us or any third parties
- Is not backed up to our servers

## Third-Party Services

DoseVault does not integrate with any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services. We do not use:

- Analytics SDKs
- Crash reporting services that transmit data
- Advertising networks
- Social media SDKs
- Any cloud services

## Data Export

The App includes an optional export feature that allows you to save your data as CSV or JSON files. When you use this feature:

- The exported file is created locally on your device
- You control where the file is saved or shared
- We have no access to exported files

## Apple Services

The App may use standard iOS features provided by Apple:

- **Local Notifications**: If you enable reminders, notification scheduling is handled entirely on your device by iOS. No notification data is sent to external servers.
- **iCloud Backup**: If you have iCloud Backup enabled on your device, your device backup may include app data. This is controlled by your iOS settings and Apple's privacy policy, not by us.

## Data Security

Since all data remains on your device, security is managed by:

- Your device's built-in security (passcode, Face ID, Touch ID)
- iOS sandboxing that prevents other apps from accessing DoseVault's data
- Apple's SwiftData encryption

We recommend enabling a device passcode to protect your data.

## Children's Privacy

DoseVault is not intended for use by children under 17. We do not knowingly collect any information from anyone, including children.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated "Last Updated" date. Since we don't collect any data, we have no way to notify you of changes directly—please review this policy periodically.

## Your Rights

Since we don't collect any personal data, there is no data for us to provide, correct, or delete. All your data is stored locally on your device, and you have full control over it. You can:

- View all your data within the App
- Export your data at any time
- Delete any or all data within the App
- Delete all data by uninstalling the App
